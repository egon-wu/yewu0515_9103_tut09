## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
My assignment is inspired by Elaine de Kooning's Untitled Bull, and I am drawn to the bold, segmented color blocking techniques in Andy Warhol's Do It Yourself (Violin) and Roy Lichtenstein's Bull III. I plan to incorporate flat color blocks, simplified outlines, and clear geometric segmentation, as well as polka dot art, into my p5.js version of the bull. This technique helps transform expressive painterly forms into abstract, programmable visuals, making it ideal for generative art. I think the strongly abstract aesthetic of Pop Art offers a structured and visually striking alternative to code-based reinterpretations.

## ðŸ§  Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To bring the abstraction to life, I will use **poseNet body-tracking in p5.js** to allow user motion to deform and recompose the abstract bull form. This interactive approach brings energy and participation, echoing the playfulness of pop art. I'm also inspired by **scanner-style wave distortion** and **ASCII symbol rendering**, which offer alternative ways to abstract visual forms.
